If a player has fewer than six cards for the third round, play with the same number of cards as the player with the least, discarding the extras.\nTO WIN:\nThe player with the most winning cards after three rounds wins!", "colors": [], "image_uris": {"small": "https://cards.scryfall.io/small/back/e/3/e3cb0f04-d6fa-4dc3-8351-9dd9075583bc.jpg?1675594877", "normal": "https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/back/e/3/e3cb0f04-d6fa-4dc3-8351-9dd9075583bc.jpg?1675594877", "large": "https://cards.scryfall.io/large/back/e/3/e3cb0f04-d6fa-4dc3-8351-9dd9075583bc.jpg?1675594877", "png": "https://cards.scryfall.io/png/back/e/3/e3cb0f04-d6fa-4dc3-8351-9dd9075583bc.png?1675594877", "art_crop": "https://cards.scryfall.io/art_crop/back/e/3/e3cb0f04-d6fa-4dc3-8351-9dd9075583bc.jpg?1675594877", "border_crop": "https://cards.scryfall.io/border_crop/back/e/3/e3cb0f04-d6fa-4dc3-8351-9dd9075583bc.jpg?1675594877"}}], "legalities": {"standard": "not_legal", "future": "not_legal", "historic": "not_legal", "timeless": "not_legal", "gladiator": "not_legal", "pioneer": "not_legal", "modern": "not_legal", "legacy": "not_legal", "pauper": "not_legal", "vintage": "not_legal", "penny": "not_legal", "commander": "not_legal", "oathbreaker": "not_legal", "standardbrawl": "not_legal", "brawl": "not_legal", "alchemy": "not_legal", "paupercommander": "not_legal", "duel": "not_legal", "oldschool": "not_legal", "premodern": "not_legal", "predh": "not_legal"}, "games": ["paper"], "reserved": false, "game_changer": false, "foil": true, "nonfoil": true, "finishes": ["nonfoil", "foil"], "oversized": false, "promo": false, "reprint": false, "variation": false, "set_id": "0c1a194b-a2ab-4eb1-88be-291ea32fad7e", "set": "mmid", "set_name": "Innistrad: Midnight Hunt Minigames", "set_type": "minigame", "set_uri": "https://api.scryfall.com/sets/0c1a194b-a2ab-4eb1-88be-291ea32fad7e", "set_search_uri": "https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=set&q=e%3Ammid&unique=prints", "scryfall_set_uri": "https://scryfall.com/sets/mmid?utm_source=api", "rulings_uri": "https://api.scryfall.com/cards/e3cb0f04-d6fa-4dc3-8351-9dd9075583bc/rulings", "prints_search_uri": "https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=released&q=oracleid%3A47aaff9e-8a25-4a76-acb2-36573ded8d2d&unique=prints", "collector_number": "2", "digital": false, "rarity": "common", "artist": "", "border_color": "black", "frame": "2015", "full_art": false, "textless": false, "booster": false, "story_spotlight": false, "prices": {"usd": null, "usd_foil": null, "usd_etched": null, "eur": null, "eur_foil": null, "tix": null}, "related_uris": {"tcgplayer_infinite_articles": "https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/4931599/1830156/21018?subId1=api&trafcat=tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Farticles&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Farticles%3FproductLineName%3Dmagic%26q%3DDay%2BVs.%2BNight%2B%252F%252F%2BDay%2Bvs.%2BNight%2B%2528cont%2527d%2529", "tcgplayer_infinite_decks": "https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/4931599/1830156/21018?subId1=api&trafcat=tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fdecks&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fdecks%3FproductLineName%3Dmagic%26q%3DDay%2BVs.%2BNight%2B%252F%252F%2BDay%2Bvs.%2BNight%2B%2528cont%2527d%2529", "edhrec": "https://edhrec.com/route/?cc=Day+Vs.+Night+%2F%2F+Day+vs.+Night+%28cont%27d%29"}, "purchase_uris": {"tcgplayer": "https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/4931599/1830156/21018?subId1=api&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3FproductLineName%3Dmagic%26q%3DDay%2BVs.%2BNight%2B%252F%252F%2BDay%2Bvs.%2BNight%2B%2528cont%2527d%2529%26view%3Dgrid", "cardmarket": "https://www.cardmarket.com/en/Magic/Products/Search?referrer=scryfall&searchString=Day+Vs.+Night+%2F%2F+Day+vs.+Night+%28cont%27d%29&utm_campaign=card_prices&utm_medium=text&utm_source=scryfall", "cardhoarder": "https://www.cardhoarder.com/cards?affiliate_id=scryfall&data%5Bsearch%5D=Day+Vs.+Night+%2F%2F+Day+vs.+Night+%28cont%27d%29&ref=card-profile&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=card&utm_source=scryfall"}}]
